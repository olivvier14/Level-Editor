# Level-Editor

👉 this is a simple level editor made in clickteam fusion 2.5, an old program used to make simple or mid advanced games and applications.

‼️ please note that the development of this application is currently paused due to focus shifting towards other projects and ongoing issues with the program used for development.

## ❗ Many bugs

this application was developed using Clickteam Fusion 2.5, which unfortunately introduces several inherent bugs and limitations that cannot be fully resolved despite extensive efforts. as a result, some issues remain persistent.

---

## 💢 Known issues

- when other tile is placed on background tile, when the level is saved and loaded, the background tile will dissapear and the tile placed on it will be visible.
- when the menu bar is hidden and spawn position is placed, every gui element may appear.
- if the level is made with snap grid off and is saved and loaded, meaningless if the snap grid is on or off, the saved tiles will be still loaded as snapped to the grid.
- if the X and Y coordinates are set to visible, they sometimes may remain visible when testing.
- the character settings are not saved to a file, planning to fix this soon.
- when the camera object is used when testing, the editor zoom may break entirely.
